## Purpose and Duties

The End User TAB is tasked with:

## Composition and Selection

The End User TAB consists of:

* At least three representatives are elected by the End User Participants at large.
* TOC-appointed members, each employed by an End User Participant.
* Additional representatives may be invited by majority approval of existing members.

## Terms and Termination

* Members serve approximately two-year terms, with staggered terms initially.
* Membership ceases if a member resigns, is removed, or changes employment away from an End User Participant.
A super-majority vote can remove members not fulfilling their duties or complying with CNCF policies.

## Vacancies and Alternates

* Vacancies are filled by election or invitation, depending on circumstances.
* End User Participants can designate alternates who can attend and vote in the absence of the primary representative.

## Eligibility and Criteria

* Members must be employees of End User Participants in good standing.
* Selection is based on operational and technical acumen in cloud native infrastructure and applications, including CNCF projects.
* No more than two representatives from the same organization may serve simultaneously.

## Additional Functions

The End User TAB may:

* Proactively address topics of concern to End Users.
* Promote market adoption of CNCF and host meetings for End Users.
* Advise the Governing Board and create SIGs or subcommittees for specialized topics.
* Develop policies and procedures consistent with this charter.
