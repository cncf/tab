## Workflow Steps

### 1. Requested

*Who: TOC*

As part of the project due diligence the TOC submits a request to the TAB to participate during adopter interviews. The TOC has information regarding the [definition of an adopter](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter) and the [template for the adopter interviews](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/operations/toc-templates/template-adopter-questions.md).

The TOC also provides an initial set of adopters to be potentially interviewed, usually provided directly by the project.

### 2. Assigned

*Who: TAB*

The TAB selects one or more members that will drive the adopter interview process and the interactions with the TOC.

### 3. Announced

*Who: Selected TAB member(s)* 

The TAB members assigned to this task reach out to the CNCF end user community to collect a larger set of project adopters that can be interviewed. The goal is to complement the initial adopter list given by the project - to ensure unbiased views as well as cover for provided organizations that do not qualify as adopters or do not show usage at the expected level.

### 4. Interviewed

*Who: Selected TOC \+ TAB members*

The main step in the process, this includes scheduling and performing the interviews with each of the adopters. This is usually done in an informal setting with an online call. A set of suggested questions is documented in [this template](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/operations/toc-templates/template-adopter-interview-request.md) but those are often extended to explore specific issues or areas of interest being raised or needing clarification.

It is essential to request explicit authorization from the adopter/organization for the publication of the interview content. If this is not possible, the information should be anonymized.

### 5. Completed

*Who: TOC \+ TAB*

The selected TOC and TAB members have completed all interviews, and mark the process complete.
